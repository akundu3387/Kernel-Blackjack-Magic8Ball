I have created virtual device drivers as Linux loadable kernel modules. Each of these modules implements a virtual character device designed to perform a specific task


In these two parts, I will be using a loadable kernel module to implement:
1: A Magic 8 Ball response system. (Similar to the toy)
2. A fully functional Blackjack game

There will be sperate Readme's for  each part with more details on how it is implemented.
